This script's goal is to generate a compact SVG (since a chess book may contain hundreds of board SVGs)
from a specified FEN string.

FEN is described at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%%E2%%80%%93Edwards_Notation
as an example, run:

fen2svg.py rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR -o output.svg
